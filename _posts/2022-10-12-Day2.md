Today I checked out XV6, as recommended by a user on Hacker News. It has proven to be exactly what I needed, and I was excited to get its recommended environment setup! I did some work on getting the blog and vlog setup. I learned about and installed Qemu, an emulator for the binary setup used in XV6. I also somehow didn't have basg or gcc installed on this computer so I got those. Bash was honestly a bit tricky bc I'm on Windows 11. At any rate, I got errands to run and food to cook so today was a bit light! 
Tomorrow I'm going to start working my way through XV6! I'm so excited the environment setup was so painless. Talk to ya then!
