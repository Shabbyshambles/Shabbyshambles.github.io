Today I did not get a ton of time to work on the project, but I read through the XV6 textbook a bit, did a bit of work understanding next steps, and just planning planning planning.
This seems like a good chance to talk about my motivation for doing this. Finding a job as a software engineer after graduating has been a difficult endeavor. In school, I was good at this stuff, but in the world I am just one somewhat talented programmer without distinction among thousands. Eventually, the rejection letters, the endless grind towards success without attaining it, it gets to you. It erodes your confidence, it erodes your work ethic, and all the while parents, friends, family, are asking what are you doing, why don't you have a job? I need to answer some questions to myself. Am I good enough to build an OS? Do I have the work ethic and follow through to see this process out? Can I build excitement and enthusiasm for this project in an endless sea of talented people trying to build excitement and enthusiasm for their project? 
Beyond just the quest for knowledge in its own right, which is a worthy enough goal, I am looking for knowledge of myself. What are my limits, how far can I push myself, do I really have what it takes to be a successful software engineer. 
Hopefully some people get invested, start cheering me on, but even if not I am going to do this. See you all at the finish line.
